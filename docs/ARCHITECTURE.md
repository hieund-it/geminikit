[Layer 5] MEMORY  Short-Term • Execution State • Long-Term
```

The system is built on a 5-layer architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability:
1.  **Entry Point:** `GEMINI.md` - Responsible for parsing commands, checking complexity, and routing to the appropriate agent.
2.  **Agents:** Specialized executors with defined roles (e.g., `planner`, `developer`). See the [Agent Registry](AGENTS_REGISTRY.md) for a complete list.
3.  **Skills:** Atomic, stateless processors that perform specific tasks (e.g., `gk-debug`, `gk-plan`).
4.  **Tools:** External I/O interfaces for interacting with the environment.
5.  **Memory System**: State management for short-term and long-term context, featuring auto-persistence, silent summarization, and self-healing.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestrator
The central brain of the system. Its primary responsibilities are:
- **Parsing**: Detecting commands and user intent from `/gk-...` inputs.
- **Decomposition**: Breaking down complex requests into manageable subtasks.
- **Delegation**: Selecting the right Agent for each task based on the [Agent Registry](AGENTS_REGISTRY.md).
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing results from various agents into a cohesive response.
- **Security Control**: Enforcing the Agent Permission Matrix and tool access limits.

### 2. Agents
Specialized entities with defined roles and rules (located in `.gemini/agents/`). They are the "who" in the system, responsible for executing tasks within their domain. Key agents include:
- **Planner**: Creates execution roadmaps for complex tasks.
- **Developer**: Implements code, fixes bugs, and manages Git.
- **Reviewer**: Analyzes code quality, security, and performance.
- **Researcher**: Gathers information and performs brainstorming.
- **Documenter**: Generates technical documentation.
- **Designer**: Produces and validates UI/UX specifications.

A complete list of agents and their skills is available in the [Agent Registry](AGENTS_REGISTRY.md).

### 3. Skills
Atomic, reusable units of functionality (located in `.gemini/skills/`). Skills are the "what" — they follow a strict Input/Output schema and perform one specific job (e.g., `gk-summarize`, `gk-analyze`, `gk-git`). They are the building blocks that agents use to accomplish their goals.

## Memory System

The Gemini Kit Memory System provides robust state management through:
- **Auto-Persistence**: Automatic state saving across sessions to ensure continuity.
- **Silent Summarization**: Background compression of long context windows to maintain model performance without user interruption.
- **Implicit Export**: Automated backup of critical session data for recovery.
- **File Locking**: Prevents concurrent modification conflicts during multi-agent execution.
- **Memory Rotation/Archiving**: Intelligently manages long-term storage and retrieval of past session insights.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic detection and recovery from corrupted state files.
- **Pinned Knowledge**: Persistent facts and user preferences that bypass rotation logic.

## Native Hooks System

Gemini CLI v0.26.0+ supports native hooks (`.gemini/settings.json` hook registration) that enable automatic state management without human intervention. Gemini Kit implements five lifecycle hooks via Node.js scripts in `.gemini/hooks/`:

### Hook Events & Responsibilities

| Event | Script | Trigger | Responsibility |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **SessionStart** | `session-start.js` | Session initialization | Load pinned context and last 3 long-term memory entries into short-term context |
| **AfterModel** | `after-model.js` | Model response received | Check token threshold; auto-summarize short-term to long-term if >25K tokens or every 10 turns; compress long-term if >15 entries |
| **PreCompress** | `pre-compress.js` | Before Gemini CLI prunes history | Snapshot short-term context to long-term to prevent loss during context compression |
| **AfterTool** | `after-tool.js` | After tool execution | Log tool name, status (success/error), and duration to execution.md; redact sensitive fields |
| **SessionEnd** | `session-end.js` | Session termination | Final long-term memory compression if overloaded; reset short-term memory |

### Hook Infrastructure

**Library Modules** (`.gemini/hooks/lib/`):
- `memory-manager.js`: CRUD operations for `.gemini/memory/*.md` files (read, write, append, trim entries)
- `gemini-summarizer.js`: Gemini API wrapper with token threshold logic and conversation summarization
- `logger.js`: Silent error logger writing to `.gemini/errors.log` (debug mode via `LOG_LEVEL=debug`)

**Configuration** (`.gemini/settings.json`):
```json
"hooks": {
  "SessionStart": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .gemini/hooks/session-start.js", "timeout": 5000 }] }],
  "AfterModel": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .gemini/hooks/after-model.js", "timeout": 30000 }] }],
  "PreCompress": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .gemini/hooks/pre-compress.js", "timeout": 10000 }] }],
  "AfterTool": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .gemini/hooks/after-tool.js", "timeout": 5000 }] }],
  "SessionEnd": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .gemini/hooks/session-end.js", "timeout": 10000 }] }]
}
```

### Memory Files

Three persistent memory files in `.gemini/memory/`:
- `short-term.md`: Session-specific context, populated at SessionStart, appended during AfterModel, cleared at SessionEnd
- `long-term.md`: Cross-session knowledge, auto-populated by AfterModel summaries and compressed when >15 entries
- `execution.md`: Tool invocation audit trail logged by AfterTool (name, status, duration, timestamps)
- `pinned.md`: Immutable system instructions and context that persist across all sessions

### Token Thresholds & Auto-Summarization

- **TOKENS_THRESHOLD**: 25,000 — trigger summarization when cumulative tokens reach this limit
- **TURNS_INTERVAL**: 10 — also summarize every 10 model turns regardless of token count
- **MAX_LONG_TERM_ENTRIES**: 15 — compress long-term memory entries when count exceeds this threshold

All summarization uses `gemini-2.0-flash` model via `@google/generative-ai` package for fast, cost-effective compression.

## Security Framework

Security is integrated at the core through:
- **Agent Permission Matrix**: A granular access control table defining which agents can access specific tools and file paths.
- **Forbidden Paths (Blacklist)**: Built-in protection for sensitive directories and files (e.g., `.env`, `.git`, `.ssh`).
- **Tool Access Control**: Strict limits on shell command execution, file system modifications, and network requests.
- **Pre-emptive Secret Masking**: Automated identification and redaction of credentials and secrets before they are processed by the LLM.

## Context Economy

Context Economy is a core system principle focused on token optimization:
- **Token Efficiency**: Every tool and skill is optimized to minimize input/output tokens.
- **Context Rotation**: Older or irrelevant context is automatically moved to long-term memory or archived to keep the active window focused.
- **Surgical Reads**: Tools prefer reading specific line ranges or symbols over entire files to reduce overhead.

## Operational Workflow


Gemini Kit follows a mandatory four-phase lifecycle for every task:

1.  **Research**: Mapping the codebase, validating assumptions, and reproducing issues.
2.  **Strategy**: Formulating a plan. For complex tasks, this involves the **Planner** agent.
3.  **Execution**: Performing the actual work (Plan -> Act -> Validate).
4.  **Validation**: Mandatory final step to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.

### Complex Task Workflow
For multi-step or ambiguous tasks (e.g., "build a login system"), the framework follows a specific planning and execution cycle:

```

## Communication Protocol
- **Structured I/O**: Agents and Skills communicate using JSON schemas defined in `.gemini/schemas/`.
- **Handoffs**: Data is passed between agents using a standard handoff envelope (from_agent, to_agent, artifacts, context).
- **Memory**: System state is persisted in `.gemini/memory/` (execution.md, long-term.md).

## Safety & Governance
- **Confirmation Gate**: Any plan modifying the system requires explicit user approval.
- **Global Rules**: Core principles like **YAGNI**, **KISS**, and **DRY** are enforced via `.gemini/system.md` and `.gemini/rules/`.

## Rules & Standards
The framework operates under strict global rules:
-   **Core:** Foundational principles and safety (`01_core.md`).
-   **Workflow:** Orchestration and execution logic (`02_workflow.md`).
-   **Resource:** Token and context optimization (`03_resource.md`).
-   **Output:** Communication protocols (`04_output.md`).
-   **Development:** Coding standards and task execution (`05_development.md`).
-   **Documentation:** Document management rules (`06_documentation.md`).
