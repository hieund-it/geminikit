# Commands Reference

This guide details the commands available in Gemini Kit, including both the core CLI tools (`gk`) and the AI-driven agent commands (`/gk-...`).

## CLI Commands

These commands manage the Gemini Kit environment and are executed directly in your terminal.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gk init` | Scaffolds the `.gemini/` directory and `GEMINI.md` configuration into the current project. Includes an interactive setup for Python environment and packages. |
| `gk list` | Lists all available agents and skills in the current project. |
| `gk update` | Updates the Gemini Kit framework to the latest version from GitHub. |
| `gk uninstall` | Removes the `.gemini/` directory and uninstalls the local runtime from the current project. |
| `gk version` | Displays the installed version of Gemini Kit. |
| `gk bridge` | Manages the Claude-Gemini bridge pipeline (subcommands: `init`, `start`, `status`, `reset`). |
| `gk token gain` | Show token savings dashboard. Options: `--history` (per-session breakdown), `--json` (machine-readable output). |
| `gk token discover` | Analyze token usage patterns to identify missed optimization opportunities. |
| `gk token report` | Generate a markdown token analytics report saved to `plans/reports/token-report-YYYYMMDD.md`. |

## AI Agent Commands

These commands invoke specialized AI agents to perform complex tasks.

```bash
/gk-<command> [--mode <value>] [arguments]

| `/gk-brainstorm` | `researcher` | Brainstorm software solutions and architectural options. |
| `/gk-compare-logic` | `comparator` | Compare business logic between legacy and new systems. |
| `/gk-create` | `developer` | Generate new skill and agent files from templates. |
| `/gk-debug` | `developer` | Identify the root cause of a software error and recommend a fix. |

- **`gk-document`** (`documenter`): Generate technical documentation.
- **`gk-git`** (`developer`): Execute git operations.
- **`gk-research`** (`planner`): Gather technical information.
