# Tool: file-output-rules

## Purpose

Rules for writing output files to disk for user consumption. Reference from any skill
that may produce large output or report-style results.

## File Output Rules

- MUST write Markdown file when: output > 100 lines OR skill.type = "report"
- MUST NOT write file if output ≤ 100 lines AND skill.type ≠ "report"
- Location: `plans/reports/{YYYYMMDD}-{slug}.md` (use skill name as slug base)
- Response MUST include `"output_file": "path/to/file.md"` in result object
- File format: Markdown (human-readable); JSON response envelope provides machine-readable form

## Usage in Skills

```
- File output: → See .gemini/tools/file-output-rules.md
