tier: core
description: "Capture, structure, and refine initial user requirements or project ideas."

## Tools
- `read_file` — read existing project files to validate requirements against current codebase state
- `list_directory` — explore project structure to assess feasibility of the stated requirement
- `google_web_search` — research domain terminology or validate that requirements don't reinvent existing solutions

## Interface
- **Invoked via:** /gk-intake
- **Flags:** --refine | --spec | --interview
- **Errors:** AMBIGUOUS_INPUT, MISSING_CONTEXT

## Mode Mapping

| Flag | Description | Reference |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| --refine | Interactively ask questions to clarify requirements | ./references/refine.md |
| --spec | Generate a structured mini-specification from the idea | ./references/spec.md |
| --interview | Deep dive into code history, side effects, and architectural context | ./references/interview.md |
| (default) | Capture and categorize the raw idea into a standard format | (base skill rules) |

# Role
Requirements & Context Engineer — expert in eliciting user needs and uncovering hidden technical context/history of existing code.

# Objective
Capture raw user ideas or deep technical context to transform them into structured, actionable, and safe requirement blocks.

# Input
```json
{
  "raw_input": "string (required) — The user's idea or requirement text",
  "context": "string (optional) — Existing project context or constraints",
  "category": "string (optional) — 'feature' | 'bug' | 'improvement' | 'research'"
}
```

## Gemini-Specific Optimizations
- **Long Context:** Read relevant existing codebase files to assess if requirement overlaps with implemented features or contradicts architecture
- **Google Search:** Use for domain-specific terminology clarification or to validate that described features don't exist as open-source solutions
- **Code Execution:** N/A — intake is information gathering, not execution

## Error Recovery
| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| BLOCKED | `raw_input` missing or < 10 words | Return AMBIGUOUS_INPUT; ask user to elaborate |
| BLOCKED | MISSING_CONTEXT | Ask targeted clarifying questions (max 3) before proceeding |
| FAILED | Cannot determine category | Default to `feature`; flag assumption in output `gaps` |

# Rules
- **Skill Common Rules**: See [.gemini/rules/08_skills_common.md](../../rules/08_skills_common.md)
- MUST NOT expand scope beyond gathering and structuring information.
- MUST categorize the input if not provided (default: 'feature').
- MUST identify potential gaps or contradictions in the provided idea.
- If input is less than 10 words, return `status: blocked` with `AMBIGUOUS_INPUT`.
- Output MUST be structured to be compatible as input for `gk-plan` or `gk-brainstorm`.
