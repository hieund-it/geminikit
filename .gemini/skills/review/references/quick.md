# Extra Rules

- Focus ONLY on critical and high-severity issues — skip medium and low.
- Summarize findings into a high-signal report for rapid iteration.
- Ignore minor style or naming inconsistencies unless they impact readability or security.
- Prioritize identifying security gaps and fundamental correctness errors.
- Limit strengths to top 2 or fewer.

## Steps
