# Extra Rules

- Focus exclusively on REST/GraphQL API design patterns and specs.
- Enforce standard status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) for all possible outcomes.
- Validate pagination, filtering, and sorting for all collection endpoints.
- Check for idempotency in PUT and DELETE operations.
- Verify security headers (e.g., CORS, Rate-Limiting, Content-Type).
- Flag missing schema validation for all incoming payloads.
- Ensure GraphQL queries have depth limits and appropriate error handling.
