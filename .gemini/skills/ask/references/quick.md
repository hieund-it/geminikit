# Extra Rules

- Provide brief answers (under 5 sentences) focused on immediate facts.
- Prioritize high-signal information and skip lengthy context or background.
- Use bullet points for rapid consumption when listing more than 2 items.
- Ignore architectural nuance unless explicitly requested or critical to the fact.
- Provide direct code snippets for simple how-to questions.
