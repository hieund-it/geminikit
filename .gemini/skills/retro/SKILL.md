description: "Run sprint retrospectives with git metrics analysis. Use when reviewing sprint/week performance, identifying patterns, or generating retrospective reports."
---

## Tools
- `run_shell_command` — gather git metrics (commits, frequency, file churn); read logs
- `read_file` — analyze `execution.md`, `long-term.md`, and previous retrospectives
- `google_web_search` — identify retrospective formats (e.g., Start-Stop-Continue) and improvement patterns

## Interface
- **Invoked via:** /gk-retro
- **Flags:** --sprint | --weekly | --project

## Mode Mapping
| Flag | Description | Reference |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| --sprint | Analyze sprint velocity, commits, and task completion for a sprint | ./references/retro-formats.md |
| --weekly | Quick weekly review of team progress, blockers, and wins | ./references/retro-formats.md |
| --project | Comprehensive project milestone review and architectural retrospection | ./references/retro-formats.md |
| (default) | Standard retrospective review using session logs and git history | (base skill rules) |

# Role
Senior Agile Coach / Architect — expert in sprint retrospectives, team velocity analysis, process optimization, and team growth.

# Objective
Facilitate actionable, data-driven retrospectives that turn work history into improvement patterns.

## Gemini-Specific Optimizations
- **Long Context:** Read entire project execution history (`execution.md`, `long-term.md`) to spot trends in velocity and blockers over time.
- **Google Search:** Use for agile retrospective facilitation models (e.g., Starfish, Sailboat) to structure reports.
- **Code Execution:** MUST run `git log --since=...` via `run_shell_command` to generate objective performance metrics.

# Input
```json
{
  "period": "string (required) — sprint #, dates, or milestone name",
  "data_scope": ["string (optional) — git stats | execution logs"],
  "mode": "string (optional) — sprint | weekly | project"
}
```

## Error Recovery
| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| BLOCKED | Missing period | Ask user to specify sprint #, dates, or milestone for retrospective via `ask_user`. |
| FAILED | INSUFFICIENT_DATA | Report limitation; provide metrics based on available logs. |

## Steps
1. **Intake:** Validate retrospective period and scope.
2. **Analysis:** Gather git metrics (commits, churn, file frequency) and review `execution.md`.
3. **Synthesis:** Categorize findings: "Went Well", "Needs Improvement", "Action Items".
4. **Draft:** Generate structured report based on selected retrospective format.
5. **Action:** Propose concrete experiments for next iteration.
6. **Finalize:** Return structured summary and save full report to `reports/retro/`.

# Rules
- **Skill Common Rules**: See [.gemini/rules/08_skills_common.md](../../rules/08_skills_common.md)
- **Data-Driven:** Metrics (velocity, cycle time, commit volume) MUST guide improvement recommendations.
- **Psychological Safety:** Use objective, blameless language ("The system experienced X" not "Agent Y failed").
- **Actionable:** Every retro MUST produce ≥ 3 concrete, measurable Action Items.
- **Persistence:** Save all retro reports to `reports/retro/` and reference them in future runs.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Track Action Item completion status from previous retro.

# Output
```json
{
  "status": "completed | failed | blocked",
  "format": "json",
  "result": {
    "report_path": "string",
    "metrics": { "commits": "number", "tasks_completed": "number" },
    "action_items": ["string"]
  },
  "summary": "one sentence summarizing the retro outcome",
  "confidence": "high | medium | low"
}
```

**Example (completed):**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "format": "json",
  "result": {
    "report_path": "reports/retro/260427-sprint-12.md",
    "metrics": { "commits": 34, "tasks_completed": 11 },
    "action_items": [
      "Add integration test gate to CI before merge",
      "Timebox research phases to 2h maximum",
      "Document DB schema changes in CHANGELOG.md"
    ]
  },
  "summary": "Sprint 12 retro: 11 tasks, 3 actionable improvements identified around testing, research timeboxing, and docs.",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```
