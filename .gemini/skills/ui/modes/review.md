# Extra Rules

- Evaluate implementation against design requirements and WCAG accessibility standards.
- Check for visual regressions, misalignment, and incorrect theme application.
- Validate responsive behavior across multiple viewport sizes.
- Identify accessibility gaps (contrast, screen reader support, keyboard nav).
- Report UI/UX inconsistencies and provide specific design fixes.
